    m_Localized: 'In the 1970s building you will find the place that every student
      should have seen from the inside: the library. Above is the most famous lecture
      hall of the university. As part of the annual education award, it already bore
      the name of soccer world champion Philipp Lahm and ESC winner Lena Meyer-Landrut.
      He is currently adorned with the likeness of actor and director Hannes Jaenicke.
      Lectures and events often take place in the 70s. Examples here are the CampusKino
      or the CampusColleg series, which is also aimed at the general public.'

    m_Localized: "Complementing the 50s building in the south, the 51s is in the
      north of the university campus. A modern building with a reddish-brown barracks
      brick look. However, it does not quite frame the campus in the north like its
      counterpart in the south. Separated by Schreglestra\xDFe, building 54 with
      the adjacent university car park and student residence is to the north. More
      than any other building, the 51er can claim to be in the hands of a faculty.
      You will find many technical facilities, laboratories and workshops in the
      only building whose basement is used. The comfortably furnished meeting room,
      which is open to all students, serves as a place to pause. There is also a
      table football and a table tennis table."

    m_Localized: "The 1992 building with its futuristic glass fronts and characteristic
      glass bridge stretches along the east side. This connects it to the 1970s building
      by the shortest route. Separated only by Sch\xF6neckerstra\xDFe, it separates
      the university from Ansbach's largest shopping facility, the Br\xFCckenCenter.
      Here, too, the distances are short. In the largest building on campus you will
      find a lot of state-of-the-art equipment across all faculties. Biological laboratories,
      a sound and photo studio, a large MacPool, a 3D laboratory and the media and
      technology dean's office speak for the glass building with the photovoltaic
      system on the roof. Connected directly to the north, you will also find the
      university's energy-friendly combined heat and power plant and its own depot."

    m_Localized: The 65er is small and inconspicuous next to its big brother, the
      50er building. And as students, you will probably rarely be in the small brick
      building. Nevertheless, it is a very important place at the university in terms
      of administration and control, because the university management and the staff
      council are based here.

    m_Localized: The decorative, red brick building with its preserved barracks look
      closes off the core campus from the south. Located directly on the federal
      highway 14, Ansbach's main traffic artery, the most striking feature of the
      U-shaped building is its large clock. However, this can only be seen from the
      inner campus. The long corridors of the four-storey building are mainly used
      for the business faculty, on the ground floor there is a professional TV studio.
      Of course, this is clearly a place for the media students on campus.

    m_Localized: In the far west you will find the only building of the university
      in which you will probably not experience a lecture. But as we all know, a
      healthy mind only flourishes in a healthy body. And it wants to be adequately
      fed and cared for. Luckily, Ansbach University of Applied Sciences has a canteen
      that takes care of you from Monday to Friday. At lunch you have the choice
      between three different main dishes (one of which is always vegetarian), a
      salad bar and various drinks. As a student, you get the whole thing at a reduced
      price and a wholesome meal at a fair price. You can enjoy the food at the long
      tables right next to the food counter, in the extension at the back or, weather
      permitting, outside on the terrace. The stone loungers in front of the canteen
      invite you to sunbathe, especially in summer. In the afternoon, however, the
      canteen does not close at all, there is only no more food distribution. You
      can meet up with your fellow students and spend time there until 5 p.m. Of
      course you can also buy something to snack and drink at the canteen counter
      or the machines in the anteroom. You can top up your CampusCard with cash or
      an EC card at two machines in the anteroom. You can only pay with your student
      ID.

    m_Localized: 'Pretty inconspicuous, the small ''53 building is in the immediate
      vicinity of the ''70. Even if it is often overlooked, it still has a great
      use within the university: it is home to the post office and telephone switchboard.'

    m_Localized: "Right next to the university car park and opposite the Br\xFCckenCenter
      is the 54er, the newest building on the Ansbach campus. Architecturally, the
      open-air courtyard immediately catches the eye after entering the new building.
      From the outside, the tiled walls hide this quite well. Every Ansbach student
      should be familiar with the bright cube and its function. After all, most of
      the administration is hidden on the three floors. Whether it's the CampusCenter,
      the student service or the International Office - at least one of the institutions
      will certainly help you at some point. A MacPool and various lecture halls
      make the building between the parking lots a modern place to study."
